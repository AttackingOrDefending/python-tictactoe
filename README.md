from tictactoe import Board

board = Board(dimensions=(4, 5))
```
* More than 2 dimensions
```python
from tictactoe import Board

board = Board(dimensions=(6, 2, 5, 8))
```
* More than 3 in a row to win
```python
from tictactoe import Board

board = Board(dimensions=(10, 10, 10), x_in_a_row=8)
```
* See the board
```python
from tictactoe import Board

board = Board(dimensions=(2, 2, 2), x_in_a_row=2)

* Generate endgame tablebases
```python
from tictactoe.egtb import Generator
import functools, operator

dimensions = (4, 3)
total_squares = functools.reduce(operator.mul, dimensions)
for index in reversed(range(total_squares + 1)):
    Generator(dimensions, 3, index)
```
* Read endgame tablebases
```python
from tictactoe.egtb import Reader
from tictactoe import Board

reader = Reader((3, 3), 3, 2)
board = Board((3, 3), 3)
board.push((0, 0))
board.push((0, 1))
print(reader.index(board))
```
